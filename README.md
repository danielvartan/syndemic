An (toy) agent-based model (ABM) that simulates the environmental health of children in Least Developed Countries (LDCs), taking into account multiple factors including water sanitation and hygiene (WASH), nutrition, air pollution, education, and access to health services.

Applications of systems science to understand and manage multiple influences within children’s environmental health in least developed countries: a causal loop diagram approach. _International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health_, _18_(6), 3010. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063010
